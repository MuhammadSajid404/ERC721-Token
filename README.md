# ERC721-Token
This repository is about ERC721(Non-fungible) Token.

## ERC721 Short Introduction

The ERC-721 standard first gained popularity through the CryptoKitties game, which for a while was the most resource intensive Ethereum network app. Each ERC721 token is unique and rare: each token of this kind has its own attributes, which makes it non-fungible.ERC-721 tokens can only be traded in whole: you cannot transfer or sell half of a digital asset. 
In this standard, a token belongs only to a physical address â€” an account represented as a user's wallet or another smart contract.

### Address Contract
It is a check on different types of Addresses like zero(0x0) address, contract address, externally owned account addresses etc.
